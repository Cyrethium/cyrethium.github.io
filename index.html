        <h2>About Cyrethium</h2>
        <p>
            Cyrethium is a Debian-based Linux distribution focused on privacy, security, and threat analysis.<br>
            It can route all system traffic through the Tor network with CyrethOnion; blocks non-Tor exit traffic and implements comprehensive configurations against potential data leaks.<br>
            It also isolates applications and websites by using a separate Tor circuit for each of them, preventing cross-traffic correlation and improving anonymity.<br><br>
            
            With tools, it can manipulate network traffic to produce fake traffic and alter packet timing, making exit node monitoring and analysis attacks much more difficult.<br><br>

            Cyrethium doesn't just offer passive protection; it provides system defense capabilities with active threat detection tools.<br>
            It includes powerful tools such as Tor node analysis, node attack detection, suspicious traffic inspection, non-Tor connection detection, and system anomaly detection.<br>
            Users can detect and prevent potential attacks in advance with node analysis tools.<br><br>

            For multi-layered anonymity, Cyrethium offers I2P network and DNSCrypt-Proxy support.<br>
            Secure web browsing is provided with Tor and I2P supported hardened custom browsers:<br><br>

            <strong>Hardened Firefox:</strong> Provides high security and stability in daily use.<br><br>
            <strong>Amnesic Firefox:</strong> Focuses on strict privacy and security, automatically deleting all traces when closed.<br><br>

            With Cyrethium Jails, every file and application can be easily sandboxed.<br>
            Hardened kernel and system settings provide high resistance against exploits, rootkits, and trojans.<br>
            Thanks to advanced security tools, malware can be detected and removed from the system both in daily use and in-depth technical analyses.<br><br>

            The distribution offers a comprehensive privacy ecosystem with more than 40 custom-designed tools.<br>
            Some usage traces are automatically cleaned at each system shutdown, ensuring continuous user privacy protection.
